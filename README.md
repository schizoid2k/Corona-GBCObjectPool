# GBC Object Pool Sample Code

This repository contains a sample app that demonstrates object pooling via my CoronaSDK plugin **GBC Object Pool**.

Download into a directory and run in the Corona Simulator, or compile and load on a device.

## About GBC Object Pool ##

GBC Object Pool is a CoronaSDK plugin that manages object pooling.  Object pooling manages the reuse of objects.  The benefits are that objects are not created/destroyed over and over during run time, which improves performance.

## Support ##

* If you have any questions about my plugin, or if there are any requests for additions, please send me an email or a private message on the forums.
